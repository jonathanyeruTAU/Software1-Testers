# Software1-Testers
All the testers for Software1 course in TAU. No acctual code, just tests.

Put the relevant files in the same directory as your code. 

You need to have JUnit insalled. 

It might be best to make a new JUnit file in eclipse and then copy the code, so that you can use the eclipse JUnit running manager.

If something doesn't work for you, look it up online.

If you have any ideas for additional tests you can make a pull request and i will add it.
